so we want AO on the block faces
We essentially need like face vertices, not half edges
face vertices and not vertices -- there are cases where
faces containing the same vertex need different AO values
for that vertex. It seems every face vertex will need to check 2
adjacent blocks.

Anyways though we actually have to fix T junctions introduced
by clipping first.

Tunneling problem: if you put a corner block in a hole and jump in you
will tunnel through some shit
